Language clearly cares about intentions. Yet both in our theories of syntactic structure and our theories of meaning, the role of intentions remains somewhat inchoate. In this talk, I present the state of the art on intentions at the syntax-semantics interface, discuss reasons why intentions have been left out in the cold, and show how representing intentions in causal models can allow us to gain empirical coverage with respect to linguistic data involving intentions.
